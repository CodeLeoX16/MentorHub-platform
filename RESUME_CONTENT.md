## Sample Interview Responses

**Q: Tell me about a challenging project you've worked on.**

"I developed MentorHub, a full-stack mentorship platform using the MERN stack that's currently deployed in production. One of the main challenges was integrating multiple third-party services - Razorpay for payments, Zoom for automated meeting scheduling, and Cloudinary for media management - while maintaining a smooth user experience. I implemented a robust webhook system to handle payment confirmations and automatically generate Zoom meeting links, which significantly reduced manual session setup time. The platform now handles the entire mentorship lifecycle from discovery to post-session feedback."

**Q: What's your experience with React?**

"In MentorHub, I built the entire frontend using React 18 with modern practices like functional components and hooks. I used Zustand for lightweight state management instead of Redux to keep the bundle size small, React Router v6 for navigation, and React Hook Form for efficient form handling with validation. The UI is built with Ant Design components styled with Tailwind CSS, making it fully responsive. I also implemented custom hooks for API calls and error handling, which made the codebase more maintainable and reusable."

**Q: Describe your experience with APIs and backend development.**

"For MentorHub's backend, I designed and built a RESTful API using Node.js and Express with 15+ endpoints handling authentication, user profiles, service listings, bookings, and payments. I implemented JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, used Joi for request validation, and created custom middleware for error handling and authentication checks. The API integrates with MongoDB using Mongoose, and I designed the schemas to optimize for common queries. I also integrated four external APIs - Razorpay, Zoom, Cloudinary, and SMTP - handling webhooks, authentication, and error scenarios for each."
