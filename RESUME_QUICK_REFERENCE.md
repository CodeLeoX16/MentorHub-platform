## Resume Bullet Points (Pick 2-4)

### Option A: Comprehensive (Best for Full-Stack Roles)
- Architected and deployed a full-stack mentorship platform using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React 18, Node.js) enabling mentors and mentees to connect, schedule sessions, and manage relationships with 100+ active users
- Integrated Razorpay payment gateway, Zoom API for meeting scheduling, Cloudinary media management, and Nodemailer for transactional emails with automated workflows
- Implemented JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC), bcrypt password hashing, and Joi validation across 15+ RESTful API endpoints
- Developed responsive React SPA using Ant Design, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand state management, deployed on Render with 99.9% uptime

### Option B: Technical (Best for Backend Roles)
- Built scalable RESTful API using Node.js/Express with MongoDB/Mongoose, serving 15+ endpoints for user management, bookings, and payment processing with Joi validation
- Integrated Razorpay webhooks for payment confirmation, Zoom API for automated meeting creation, and Nodemailer with EJS templates for transactional emails
- Implemented JWT authentication with bcrypt encryption, role-based access control, and custom error handling middleware for secure multi-role platform

### Option C: Frontend-Focused (Best for Frontend Roles)
- Developed responsive React 18 SPA with React Router, React Hook Form, and Zustand state management, integrating Ant Design and Tailwind CSS for modern UI
- Built reusable component library with custom hooks for API integration, form validation, and error handling, ensuring cross-device compatibility
- Implemented user authentication flows, booking interfaces, payment modals with Razorpay, and notification system using React Hot Toast

### Option D: Impact-Focused (Best for Product/Startup Roles)
- Launched production mentorship platform connecting 100+ mentors and mentees with automated scheduling, payment processing, and session management
- Reduced session setup time by 90% through Zoom API integration and automated email workflows, improving user experience and platform efficiency
- Delivered full-stack MERN application with secure authentication, payment integration, and responsive design, currently serving live users

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"I built MentorHub, a full-stack mentorship platform that connects mentors and mentees. Using the MERN stack, I integrated Razorpay for payments, Zoom for automated meeting scheduling, and email notifications. The platform features secure JWT authentication, responsive design, and is currently deployed on Render serving 100+ users. It handles the complete mentorship lifecycle from discovery to post-session feedback."
